# @spraoi/base

> React components that will likely be used in most projects.

This package is currently just a proxy to the [Rebass component library](https://rebassjs.org), but it will likely
mutate and grow over time.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @spraoi/base
```

## Usage

```javascript
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  Card,
  Flex,
  Heading,
  Image,
  Link,
  Text,
} from '@spraoi/base';
```

You can refer to the [Rebass documentation](https://rebassjs.org/getting-started) for details on how to use these
components.
